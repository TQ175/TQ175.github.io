        <h3 id="WIV">What is Volleyball?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Volleyball is a game played between two teams of six, each team
            trying to make a ball fall into each other's side while ensuring the
            ball goes over the net that divides the court Each team is only
            allowed three touches on the ball before having to return the ball
            to the other side of the court. There should be no consecutive
            touches of the ball by the same player.

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Setter</b></p>
            </li>
            <p>
              The setter is essentially the "Maestro" of the game as they make
              the decisions on where to attack and who gets to spike. The setter
              usually gets the second touch and has to make use of all their
              attackers.They control most of the game and has the most
              responsibilty to ensure their team is in peak condition.
            </p>
            <li>
              <p><b>Outside Hitter</b></p>
            </li>
            <p>
              The outside hitter spikes from the left side of the court and has
              to have a high endurance to jumping as they need to noy only jump
              to spike, but also block attacks from the other team if need be.
              They are important for the offence and ensures that they are
              versatile enough to hit any type of ball set to them.
            </p>
            <li>
              <p><b>Opposite Hitter</b></p>
            </li>
            <p>
              The opposite hitter spikes from the right side of the court and
              has to be powerful enough to attack not only from the right side,
              but also from the back row. Opposite hitters also join in blocking
              if need be but usually are focusing on attacking the ball.
            </p>
            <li>
              <p><b>Middle Blocker</b></p>
            </li>
            <p>
              The middle blockers sepcialise in blocking the opponent's attack,
              either by completely stopping the ball in hopes the ball falls
              into the opponent's court or to slow the ball down for the other
              players to receive a easier ball. When blocking, even if the ball
              touches one's arms or hands, it does not count as a "touch" so
              middle blockers can make use of this to help their teams set up a
              better a better attack.
            </p>
            <li>
              <p><b>Libero</b></p>
            </li>
            <p>
              The Libero is the "Guardian" of the team, having to focus solely
              on receiving the ball, no matter what. Unlike other players, the
              libero stays on the floor for the most of it and can only play in
              the back row. This means that they have to substitute with another
              player every time a rotation calls for it. The libero usually
              wears a jersey of a different color than their teammates and have
              to be agile and fast as they have to cover a large area of the
              court while "digging" up spikes.

        <h3 id="Rot">Rotation</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Players have to rotate in a clockwise direction by one "position"
            after winning a point from the other team. If a team scores
            consecutive points, they do not need to rotate again. The main thing
            is the Overlap Rule. The rule states that before an opponent's
            serve, players are not allowed to 'overlap' with the player directly
            in front, behind, or beside them.

            An overpowering team that has dominated the sport for almost two
            decades. Volleyball is a major sport in Brazil, so it is no surprise
            that this team of giants can be found easily. With coaches like
            Bernardo guiding its players, the Brazillian team have been able to
            secure its dominance throughout the years, using their adaptable
            playstyle to focus on the weaknesses of their opponents, and their
            all-roundedness in tersm of technique to outplay their opponents.

            The "underdog" team that never fails to keep the audiences
            entertained and coming back for more. The Japanese team are widely
            known for their explosive, fast and scrappy playstyle, keeping their
            opponents on their toes. The players on the Japanese team are
            regarded as short by normal volleyball standards, and yet, they seem
            to still have the freedom of choice during games, be it for
            blocking, setting or spiking. They are able to think fast and be
            quick on the offence. Thier unpredictable yet explosive playstyle
            has brought them far in the world of volleyball.

            athletes have a chance to grow even more by playing against each
            other, allowing for the final team to be forever incomplete as they
            keep on growing.

            An overall explosive and powerful team, the Turkish team has
            steadily and consistently grown over the years. They have shown
            immense progress through much hard work and dedication, forming a
            united front as the team pushes each other to the limit and helping
            each other, be it on or off the court. Thier sheer dominance at the
            net, housing canons for players, it is no wonder they were gifted
            with the name "Sultans of the net". This name not only spurred the
            team on to acheive more but also drove more people in Turkey to pick
            up the sport.

            A team driven by each and every play, playing as one body, the
            Italian team has yet to let the crowd down with thier spectacular
            teamwork. Even with a star-player in their midst, they ensure each
            player imposes a threat to thier opponents, reminding them not to
            let thier guard down. This was achieved through not only rigorous
            training, but also through mental shaping. The Italian team have all
            came to a consensus of the "hear and now" mentality, which drives
            them to focus solely on the moment, raising their senses in the game
            and allowing them to break free of any anxiety and hesitation they
            may have.

            Persistent and strong, the American team dominates the court as they

            bright path for any aspiring athlete to excel, along with a
            supportive community, young athletes get a chance to not only build
            a strong foundation, but also improve at a rapid speed. With such a
            strong foundation, it is no wonder why the American team have taken
